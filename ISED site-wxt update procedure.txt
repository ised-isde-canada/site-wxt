Procedure to update site-wxt

cd site-wxt

git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/ised-isde-canada/site-wxt.git (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/ised-isde-canada/site-wxt.git (push)
upstream	https://github.com/drupalwxt/site-wxt.git (fetch)
upstream	https://github.com/drupalwxt/site-wxt.git (push)

git checkout 8.x
git pull
git fetch upstream
git merge upstream/8.x
git push

Here is the best way to get updates without having to deal with conflicts.
In summary, we merge all the changes from upstream, then we reset composer.lock to what it was.
Then we run a composer update and commit the change.

git checkout 8.x
cp composer.json ..
cp composer.lock ..
git checkout ised-8.dev
git merge 8.x (expect merge conflicts)
git reset -- composer.lock
git checkout composer.lock
composer update
git add (whatever)
git commit -m "Upgrade to 3.0.xx)

--- OLD ---

mv ../composer.json .
mv ../composer.lock .
composer install
vi composer.json and re-add ised customizations
composer update
commit
git checkout ised-8.x
git merge ised-8.dev
git push

--- THEN ---

Build a Docker image

docker build -t my-drupal-wxt .
